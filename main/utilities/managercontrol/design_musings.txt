The Readout GUI configuration parameter requirements are very different 
from ReadoutShell.

If we assume the user has created is readout programs using the
wizard then the sequences have all of the stuff needed to make those
programs transition, but, it's nice to be able to monitor
their liveness.  So we need:

1.  Connection parameters (where is the manager runniing and under which user name
    optionally, services for the manager REST server and the output monitor.

2.  List of readout programs.


Let's postulate the existence of a TOML configuration file in the wd of the
control panel (TOML Since it supports arrays)

What it might have:

title = "Configuration file for manager control panel GUI"

[connection]
host = "localhost"    #  Manager is in the same system
rest_service="DAQManager"                    # ReST service
monitor_service "DAQManager-outputMonitor"   # Output monitor service.
user = "ron"                                 # user running the manager.

[programs]
readouts=["pgm1", "pgm2"...]                 # Readout programs to monitor.


We can have a class that uses the tomllib to load the configuration file which we'll call
panel.config.

We'll have methods to fetch/modify and re-write the file.

Having all of this, we can connect to the server and set up monitoring.
