"""
Provide a program listing widget.  This is used to provide information abou8t
programs - whether they are running or not and their type.

We have two classes here, though only one of them should be considered public:

ProgramModel - contains is a StandardItemModel that dessribes the
    current set of monitored programs and their states.  It knows how to
    update itself given the dict description of program gotten from the 
    API.    This need not be instantiated by the client.
ProgramView - TableView widget that contains a ProgramModel for its data.
   ProgramView automatically instantiates a ProgramModel which is why user code
   generall need not do so.

        This is a standard item model that provides information about monitored programs.
        The columns are as  follows:
        
        Name  - name of the program.
        Host  - Where the program runs.
        Container - name of the container it runs in
        Type  - Program type (e.g. Critical).
        Active - Is program active.
        
        The intention is that this model can be incorporated into ProgramView to supply its data
        
    There's only one public method of note and that's:
        update - which should be handed the results of a Programs.status() call.
